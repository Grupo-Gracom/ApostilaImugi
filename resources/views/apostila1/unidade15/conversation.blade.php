				<p style="margin-top: 16px"><b>Akira Suzuki :</b> hello. My name is Akira Suzuki. I will be your professor for web designing and photoshop. It is a great pleasure to be with you</p>
				<p><b>Akira Suzuk :</b> I was born in japan and I lived there until the age of 27. I am now 32 years old. I am a professional web designer. I have worked in this area for over 15 years. Before working as a web designer, I worked with graphic designing for a few years.</p>
				<p><b>Akira Suzuki :</b>  I decided to work in web designing because my family had a small company and we needed a website, so I wanted to develop it.</p>
				<p><b>Akira Suzuki :</b> in my area, photoshop is of extreme importance because it is used to make the layout of the sites. It is not a simple process.</p>
				<p><b>Akira Suzuki : </b>  I hope to help all of you understand how photoshop assists web designers.</p>
